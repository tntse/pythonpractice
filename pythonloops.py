list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

# basic loop structure

# for i in list:
# 	print(i)

# the for loop translates to... 
# for each element i in list:
# do something, in this case print(i)

# for i in range(0, len(list)-1 ):
	# print(list[i])
# this is also a loop except we choose where to start using the index
# to chose which element to print

# we can throw in a if statement to only print or do something IF something is true
# lets say we want to print odd numberss only how do we test that?
# num = 10 % 2 ,num would = 0,  % gives us the remainder after division (10 divided by 2 remainder = 0)  
# so a num is odd when a number % 2 is not 0
# if(num % 2 == 0 ) what do we have?


# === PRACTICE ===
# 1. print all the elements from the list
# 2. print the first 3 elements from list
# 3. print the last 3 elements from the list
# 4. print only the even elements of the list
# 5. sum up the numbers of the list 
# 6. sum up all the odd numbers of the list
