# WELCOME TO THE PRACTICE

# === PYTHON BASICS ===
# === PYTHON BASICS ===

# i have variables set up for practice
number1 = 26 		#int
number2 = "26"  	#string
number3 = 26.0  	#float 
list1 = [1,2,3,4,5] #list of int
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] #list of char, because of single quotes ''
list3 = ["e", "f", "g", "h"] #list of string, because of double quotes ""

# So in order to use the function print() what you pass in must be the same type int or string, 

# python provides functions to convert variables between types str() and int()
# str(x) turns x into a string
# int(x) turns x into a integer if it can , int("hello") wouldnt work
# you can add lists together without converting

# lists has indexs to access the elemnts in it starting from 0
# list2[0] would equals the first elemnt which is 'a' 
# list2[2] would equal 'c'
# you can also get the length of the list using len(list1), which would get us 5

# 1. print number1 and number2 on the same line as int
# 2. print number1 and number2 on the same line as string
# 3. print list1 
# 4. print list2 and list3 on the same line
# 5. print the length of list2 
# 6. print the first and last element of list1, you should get 1 and 5

# 7. assign your name and age to the variables and print it in the format
# My name is {yourname} and I'm age {yourage}
yourname = ""
yourage = ""

# example.
